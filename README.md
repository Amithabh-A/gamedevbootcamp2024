Please find the resources we've used for yesterday's bootcamp session below:
[Bootcamp Day 1](https://github.com/Amithabh-A/gamedevbootcamp2024/blob/main/Day1.md)

The **problems we've solved yesterday** are there **in the above link**. We have used a programming language called **GdScript**, which is similar to Python and very easy to learn and use. GdScript is used for scripting when we develop the games.

If you **want to try out any stuff in gdscript** without using godot, you can go to this link: [https://gd.tumeo.space/](https://gd.tumeo.space/)

Yesterday, we covered a simple programming introduction. We will start making the game from today onwards. **If any of you have missed yesterday's session, it is okay; we'll cover up the necessary details you need individually if there is anything needed.**

gdscript tutorial : [Tutorial](https://github.com/Amithabh-A/gamedevbootcamp2024/blob/main/tutorial.gd)
Currently, tutorial link contains nothing. We will **update the tutorial by 1 pm today.**

The Gamedev session starts at 6pm today. 

Even if you don't know anything, kindly join. We'll cover you up individually with required basics.
